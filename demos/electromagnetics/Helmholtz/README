Program helmholtz
-----------------
A finite element code using OFELI to solve Helmholtz equation in a
bounded 2-D domain

The program is tested with an exact solution given in the class User.
Mesh files proj-10.m, proj-20.m, proj-40.m and proj-80.m produce
various discretization errors.

Modify file proj.dat to run the program with these mesh files.
See documentation for a description of the test.

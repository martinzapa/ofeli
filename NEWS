New in 2.3.0, 2013-7-25; Rachid Touzani:

* Added: Shape functions for edge elements for tetrahedra
* Improved: Documentation
* Added: Some preliminary member functions to prepare for DG implementation
* Added: Member functions for class Mesh to read mesh files in various external formats
* Modified: Demo lelas3d: The mesh file has been modified to boundary conditions
* Fixed: A bug in class Point<>
* Fixed: A bug in getMesh.cpp in the function getEasyMesh
* NEW: The ofeli package doesn't contain the devcpp project manager anymore, this one being obsolete.
       Microsoft Visual Studio and CodeBlocks projects have been rearranged  
* NEW: The XCode workspace for the library is now added. It is located in ofeli/tools.
* Modified: The Domain file format has been modified.
* Modified: The utility application GenMesh has been removed and replaced by g2m which has
  modified arguments. Once the package installed, type g2m --help
* Real numbers typed double are now real_t
* In class IOField, enumerated values for type are now member of class IOField

New in 2.3.1, 2013-10-30; Rachid Touzani:

* Fixed: An error in class Point2D
* Added: In class Node, a member function setCoord(Point<double>) 
* Fixed: An error in class Timer
* Added: Class for shape functions for the 3-D pentahedral element
* Added: A member function Rescale for class Mesh: It enables rescaling node coordinates

New in 3.0.0, 2014-2-15; Rachid Touzani:

* All source and include subdirectories are changed. You have to
  modify your source codes accordingly.
* The library is no more stored in the svn repository. It is now stored in a Github repository
* Fixed: An error in class Point2D
* Added: In class Node, a member function SetCoord(Point<double>)
* Fixed: An error in class Timer
* Added: Class for shape functions for the 3-D pentahedral element
* Added: A member function Rescale for classes Domain and Mesh: It enable
  rescaling node coordinates

New in 3.0.1, 2015-9-20; Rachid Touzani:

* Some parameters to read by class IPF have now default values (See corresponding member functions) 
* Petsc wrapping is now available. Not tested enough
* Eigen library interface implemented. Tested and will be documented soon

New in 3.0.2, 2015-12-4; Rachid Touzani:

* Added: operator= in class Vect to assign strings as regular expressions
* Starting of implementation of ODE solver classes: More stable version in 3.1.0
* Update of project files for Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 3.1.0, 2016-2-15; Rachid Touzani:

* The repository is now hosted by git at: github.com/rtouzani/ofeli
* Added: Solver for symmetric eigenvalue problems as well as demo programs to test it
* Removed: Old solver Eigen
* Added: In class DMatrix, QR decomposition and solution of the linear system.
* Modified: In classes DMatrix and DSMatrix. Function Factor is renamed solveLU in DMatrix and
  solveLDLt in DSMatrix. The function Solve is replaced by a function solveLU (resp. solveLDLt)
  which factorizes the matrix as well if this was not done. In future releases, old functions will be
  removed.
* Fixed: Workspace and projects for Visual Studio work now.
